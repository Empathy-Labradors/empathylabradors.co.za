			<img src="img/nicola.jpg" alt="" class="pull-left">

			<p>Nicola du Toit is a UX&nbsp;designer, user research specialist&nbsp;and a musician. She has a Bachelor of Music and a Masters in IT, specialising in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

			<p>As a UX designer Nicola‚Äôs career includes educational technology, open source and traditional publishing, front-end development, project management, UX training and e-commerce experience. She is a published author and has spoken and presented workshops at the UX South Africa conference and Wordcamp Cape Town. She strongly believes that human-centred, inclusive design makes the world a better place.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When she‚Äôs not drawing wireframes and grumbling about bad UX on Twitter, Nicola plays cello with the <a href="https://nightlightcollective.co.za/">Night Light Collective</a>, and co-curates the <a href="http://betwixtmusic.co.za">Betwixt</a>&nbsp;live music series.</p>

	    	<h2>Steve Barnett</h2>

	    	<img src="img/steve.jpg" alt="" class="pull-left">

	        <p>Steve Barnett works as Front-end developer and User Experience consultant. He loves applying User-Centered Design principles to Front-end development. He likes helping people learn new things and being involved with the local dev community.</p>

			<p>He loves sharing what he learns, so <a href="http://medium.com/@maxbarners">he writes about it</a>,&nbsp;speaks at conferences, and facilitates workshops. If he‚Äôs not busy with one of those, he‚Äôs probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/">taking pictures of it</a>.</p>

			<p>Sometimes he writes things about himself in the third person and it feels a bit odd ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.</p>
